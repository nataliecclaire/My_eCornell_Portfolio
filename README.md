Hello! Welcome to my eCornell Portfolio - this contains my capstone project from Break Through Tech, a model that determines if a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit or not, using data pulled from Portuguese banks.

I found the data on UC Irvine's ML Repository. Feel free to take a look as I go through the ML cycle and analyze performance of different models. Here's the link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

To run the model:
1. Click on the file labeled "MLFoundationsCapstoneProject.ipynb"
2. Click the "Download raw file" button in the top right of the notebook.
3. Go to Google Colab or Kaggle and upload the file to a new notebook.
4. Download the dataset I used from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Respository either using the link above or by downloading the file labeled "bank-additional-full.csv" under this repository.
5. Upload the file to your new notebook on Google Colab/Kaggle. You can upload the dataset on Google Colab by clicking on the file button to the left or on Kaggle using the input tab at the top.
6. Run all the cells and watch the model work! Follow along with my descriptions to get a feel for how/why I'm doing each step.

Thanks for stopping by - have a great day! :)
