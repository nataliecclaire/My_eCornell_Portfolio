Hello! Welcome to my eCornell Portfolio.
This portfolio is under construction, but for now, take a look at my capstone project!
I developed a model that determines if a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit or not, using data pulled from Portuguese banks.
I found the data on UC Irvine's ML Repository. Feel free to take a look as I go through the ML cycle and analyze performance of different models.
Thanks for stopping by - have a great day! :)
